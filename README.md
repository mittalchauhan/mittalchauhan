## 🔬 Selected Research Highlights

### 🛡️ Sentinel Gold: Cyber-Physical Fusion
* **Strategic Problem:** Modern security suffers from disconnected digital threat feeds and physical surveillance silos.
* **Research Solution:** A fusion engine correlating high-velocity **Kafka** indicators with live CCTV telemetry via **PySpark**.
* **Outcome:** Leverages GPT-2 to generate automated executive summaries, bridging the gap between technical telemetry and management-level reporting.

### 🧠 ELS-Pulse: Sarcasm-Aware Brand Intelligence
* **Strategic Problem:** Linguistic nuances like sarcasm cause "sentiment flipping," leading to high error rates in automated brand audits.
* **Research Solution:** A **Voting Ensemble** (87.1% accuracy) utilizing custom sarcasm-aware heuristics to identify linguistic nuances.
* **Outcome:** Provides high-fidelity sentiment auditing through Neural Probability Heatmapping and TF-IDF feature significance analysis.

### 📊 InsuraPulse: Explainable AI for Risk
* **Strategic Problem:** The "Black Box" nature of complex regression models prevents actuarial transparency and stakeholder trust.
* **Research Solution:** Applied **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** to isolate and interpret non-linear drivers in medical premiums.
* **Outcome:** Delivers transparent, auditable models by normalizing skewed residual patterns through Log-Linear transformations.

### 📈 QuantPro: Quantitative Signal Processing
* **Strategic Problem:** Financial research requires low-latency pipelines capable of extracting signals from high-velocity data.
